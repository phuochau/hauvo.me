# hauvo.me

This is my portfolio site, it was built by VueJS, NuxtJS and Ghost blogging platform. The ghost headless is hosting on Heroku and the static site is hosting on Netlify.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
